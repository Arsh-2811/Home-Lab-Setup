# The Self-Hosted Private Cloud: A Definitive Guide

Welcome to a comprehensive, six-part series where I document my journey of transforming an underutilized laptop into a powerful, secure, and fully automated private cloud. If you've ever been concerned about data privacy, curious about what happens behind the scenes of the cloud services you use daily, or simply love to learn by building, you've come to the right place.

This series is more than just a step-by-step tutorial. It's a chronicle of discovery, complete with the problems I encountered, the concepts I learned, and the "aha!" moments that transformed my understanding of networking, security, and infrastructure management. We will build this entire system from the ground up, based on three core principles:

* **Security by Design:** Security isn't an afterthought; it's a foundational layer. We will make choices from the very beginning that prioritize a secure and resilient architecture.
* **Reproducibility (Infrastructure as Code):** Every component of our server will be defined in code and stored in a Git repository. This means we can reliably tear down and rebuild the entire system, a core practice in modern DevOps.[^1]
* **Learning Through Understanding:** I won't just tell you what to type; I'll explain *why* we're typing it. We'll dive into the core concepts behind every tool and decision.

By the end of this series, you'll not only have a sophisticated home lab but also a deep, practical understanding of skills that are highly valuable in professional IT and DevOps roles.[^2]

You can follow along and find all the configuration files in my public GitHub repository:

## Article 1: The Foundation - A Secure, Container-Ready Server

### Introduction: The "Why" of Self-Hosting

The modern digital landscape offers immense convenience, but often at the cost of personal data privacy. Every photo uploaded, every file synced, every service used is another piece of our lives entrusted to a large corporation. The motivation to self-host stems from a desire to reclaim control over this data, transforming capable but underutilized hardware into a private, powerful, and personal cloud platform.

This journey is about more than just saving a few dollars on subscription fees. It's a hands-on education in the technologies that power the internet. The principles we'll follow—Security by Design, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Learning Through Understanding—are not just for hobbyists. They are the core tenets of modern DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). The skills you'll acquire by building this home lab, from container orchestration with Docker to implementing zero-trust security models, are directly transferable to professional roles like DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, and Systems Administrator. This project is your personal proving ground.

### High-Level System Architecture

Before we dive in, let's look at our destination. The end goal is a sophisticated yet manageable home server architecture. A client device, located anywhere in the world, will establish a secure connection through an overlay network to our home server. This server, running the Docker container platform, will intelligently route requests to a suite of containerized services, each running in secure isolation.

This guide is based on a system with the following specifications, which establishes a relatable baseline for performance and capabilities:

* **CPU:** Intel Core i5 (9th Gen)
* **RAM:** 16 GB
* **Storage:** 1 TB SSD
* **GPU:** NVIDIA GTX 1650 (This will be important later for hardware-accelerated video transcoding)

### Phase 1: Foundational OS and Docker Installation

Every great structure needs a solid foundation. For our private cloud, this foundation consists of a stable operating system, hardened security, and a robust containerization platform.

#### Initial Server Setup

We'll use Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS as our host operating system. Its long-term support, massive community, and excellent hardware compatibility make it an ideal choice.

During the installation process, the most important step is to create a non-root administrative user. Throughout this guide, we will perform all actions as this user, using the `sudo` command to elevate privileges when necessary. Directly operating as the `root` user is a significant security risk, as a single mistake could have system-wide consequences.

#### Securing the Perimeter

With the OS installed, our first priority is to lock the doors. We'll implement two fundamental security measures.

**1. SSH Hardening:**
Secure Shell (SSH) will be our primary method of accessing the server's command line. By default, it allows password-based logins, which are vulnerable to automated brute-force attacks. We will disable this in favor of cryptographic key pairs.

* **Generate SSH Keys:** On your client machine (your laptop), generate an SSH key pair if you don't already have one.
* **Copy Public Key to Server:** Copy the public key to your server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* **Disable Password Authentication:** On the server, edit the SSH configuration file at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and set `PasswordAuthentication no`. After restarting the SSH service (`sudo systemctl restart sshd`), the server will only accept connections from clients that possess the corresponding private key, effectively shutting down brute-force attackers.

**2. Firewall Configuration:**
Next, we'll configure a firewall to control network traffic. We'll use UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) because it provides a user-friendly interface for managing `iptables`, the underlying Linux packet filtering tool.[^3]Our strategy is "deny by default, allow by exception."

First, set the default policies:

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
````

This blocks all incoming connections while allowing the server to initiate connections to the outside world (e.g., for system updates).

Next, we'll explicitly allow SSH traffic. Without this step, enabling the firewall would lock us out of our own server.

```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

Finally, enable the firewall:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Our server is now protected by a basic but effective security perimeter.

#### Installing the Containerization Runtime

With the host secured, the final foundational step is to install Docker. Docker allows us to package applications and their dependencies into standardized, isolated units called containers. For a home lab, this is a game-changer:

* **Service Isolation:** Each app runs in its own environment, so a dependency for one app can't conflict with another.\<sup\>3\</sup\>
* **Reproducibility:** Docker Compose files let us define our entire application stack in code, making it easy to rebuild services consistently.\<sup\>1\</sup\>
* **Portability:** Containers run the same way everywhere, from our home lab to a massive cloud provider.

We will install Docker Engine and Docker Compose from Docker's official repositories. While Ubuntu includes a version of Docker in its own repositories, the official Docker repository ensures we get the latest versions with all the newest features and security patches.\<sup\>4\</sup\>

**Step-by-Step Installation:**

1. **Set up the repository:** First, install the necessary packages to allow `apt` to use a repository over HTTPS and add Docker’s official GPG key to ensure the authenticity of the packages.\<sup\>5\</sup\>

    ```bash
    # Add Docker's official GPG key:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg) -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

    # Add the repository to Apt sources:
    echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu) \
      $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

2. **Install the Docker packages:** Install the latest versions of the Docker Engine, command-line interface (CLI), `containerd` runtime, and the Docker Compose plugin.\<sup\>4\</sup\>

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
    ```

3. **Post-Installation Steps:** By default, running Docker commands requires root privileges. To manage Docker as our non-root user, we need to add our user to the `docker` group.

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

    For this change to take effect, you must log out of your current session and log back in, or simply reboot the server.

4. **Verification:** Finally, let's confirm that Docker is installed and running correctly by executing the classic "hello-world" container.\<sup\>5\</sup\>

    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

A successful run will display a message confirming that your installation appears to be working correctly. This tells us that the Docker daemon is operational, can communicate with the Docker Hub public registry, and has successfully pulled and run a container image.

Our foundation is now complete. The server OS is hardened, access is secured, and the Docker runtime is ready. In the next article, we'll build the secure network that will connect our private cloud to the world.

## Article 2: The Network - Building a Secure, Location-Independent Mesh

### Introduction: The Problem with Port Forwarding

With our server hardened and ready, the next task is to architect a secure and flexible network for remote access. The traditional method for this is port forwarding. This involves configuring your home router to forward incoming traffic on a specific port (e.g., port 443 for HTTPS) to the internal IP address of your server.

However, this approach has a fundamental security flaw: it punches a hole in your network's perimeter, exposing that service directly to the public internet. This makes it an immediate target for automated bots that constantly scan the internet for open ports and known vulnerabilities. The VPN gateway becomes a publicly discoverable and attackable surface.\<sup\>6\</sup\> We can do better. We will build a modern, more secure zero-trust overlay network that requires no open ports at all.

### Core Concept: Mesh VPNs vs. Traditional VPNs

To understand the solution, we first need to understand the problem with traditional VPNs.

**Traditional "Hub-and-Spoke" VPN:**
Imagine a company with a central office and remote employees. In a traditional VPN, all communication is routed through the central office. If two remote employees want to talk to each other, their data travels from one employee, to the central office, and then back out to the other employee. This "hub-and-spoke" model, common in older VPN technologies, sends all traffic through a single server. This creates a performance bottleneck, increasing latency and slowing things down, especially if the central server is geographically distant.\<sup\>7\</sup\>

*A simple diagram showing multiple "spoke" devices connecting to a central "hub" server, with arrows indicating all traffic flows through the hub.*

**Mesh "Peer-to-Peer" VPN:**
A mesh VPN, such as Tailscale, fundamentally changes this model. Instead of a central hub, it creates a flat, peer-to-peer (P2P) network where each device (or "node") establishes a direct, encrypted connection with every other device it needs to communicate with. Using our office analogy, this is like employees having direct phone lines to each other, bypassing the central switchboard entirely. This decentralized approach eliminates the central bottleneck, resulting in significantly lower latency and higher throughput.\<sup\>7\</sup\>

*A diagram showing multiple devices connected in a mesh, with direct lines between each pair of devices, illustrating the P2P connections.*

### How Tailscale Works Under the Hood

Tailscale brilliantly combines two distinct components: a control plane and a data plane.

* **Control Plane:** This consists of Tailscale's coordination servers. When you add a new device to your network, it authenticates with the control plane, which then helps it exchange the public keys needed to establish encrypted tunnels with other devices. The control plane is like the phone book and the operator who connects the call.
* **Data Plane:** This is the network that carries your actual user traffic. Tailscale uses the modern, high-performance, and highly secure WireGuard protocol for its data plane.

Crucially, your data never flows through Tailscale's servers. The control plane only facilitates the setup of direct, end-to-end encrypted WireGuard connections between your own devices.\<sup\>10\</sup\> This is a critical distinction for anyone concerned with privacy and security.

This architecture represents a fundamental shift in security mindset. Traditional VPNs often operate on a "castle-and-moat" model: once you're authenticated and inside the network, you're often treated as trusted and may have broad access.\<sup\>6\</sup\> Tailscale, by its nature, enables a zero-trust approach. Each connection is individually authenticated, and access can be finely controlled. A device being on your private network (your "tailnet") doesn't automatically grant it access to everything. This aligns our home lab with modern corporate security practices, moving from "trust but verify" to "never trust, always verify."

### Implementation: Deploying Your Private Tailscale Network

One of Tailscale's greatest strengths is its simplicity. We can have a secure mesh network up and running in minutes.\<sup\>10\</sup\>

1. **Install Tailscale on the Server:**
    The recommended installation method is a simple script that handles adding the necessary repositories and packages.\<sup\>11\</sup\>

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL [https://tailscale.com/install.sh](https://tailscale.com/install.sh) | sh
    ```

2. **Authenticate the Server:**
    Next, we'll bring the server online and connect it to our private network (our tailnet).

    ```bash
    sudo tailscale up
    ```

    This command will output a URL. You must visit this URL in a browser on another device, log in with an identity provider (like Google, Microsoft, or GitHub), and authorize the new server to join your network.

3. **The Magic IP Address:**
    Once authenticated, the server is assigned a stable IP address in the `100.x.y.z` range. This IP is private to your tailnet and will remain permanently associated with the server, regardless of its physical location or the local network it's connected to. This is the key to the "location-independent architecture" we're building. You can find this IP at any time by running:

    ```bash
    tailscale ip -4
    ```

4. **Best Practice for Servers: Disable Key Expiry:**
    By default, Tailscale keys expire and require re-authentication periodically. For a server that should always be available, this is not ideal. We can disable key expiry for our server to ensure it stays connected permanently.

      * Log in to the Tailscale admin console at `https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines`.
      * Find your server in the list, click the three-dot menu on the right, and select "Disable key expiry...".

5. **Connect a Client:**
    To complete the network, install the Tailscale client on another device, such as your laptop or smartphone, and authenticate it using the same process.

6. **Verification:**
    Once both devices are part of the same tailnet, they can communicate directly using their Tailscale IP addresses. From your client device, open a terminal or command prompt and ping the server's Tailscale IP.

    ```bash
    ping 100.x.y.z
    ```

    If you receive a reply, your secure, location-independent mesh network is fully operational. You can now securely access your server from anywhere in the world without having opened a single port on your router.

## Article 3: The Backbone - DNS, Reverse Proxy, and Internal Architecture

### Introduction: Architecting for Scalability and Simplicity

With our server accessible via a secure, location-independent network, the next stage is to construct the architectural backbone of our private cloud. This involves deploying core infrastructure services that will manage internal network traffic, provide human-readable names for our services, and enable the secure, scalable addition of future applications.

This article details the deployment of three critical components: Pi-hole for DNS-level ad-blocking and local name resolution, Nginx Proxy Manager as our reverse proxy, and the custom Docker networks that allow them to communicate effectively. This backbone is the key to creating a system where adding a new service is a simple, repeatable process rather than a complex networking challenge.

### Pi-hole: Your Network's DNS Gatekeeper

Every time you visit a website like `example.com`, your device first performs a DNS (Domain Name System) query to translate that human-readable name into a machine-readable IP address. Pi-hole positions itself as your local network's DNS server, inspecting every single one of these queries.

#### Core Concept: What is a DNS Sinkhole?

Pi-hole functions as a DNS sinkhole. It maintains extensive, community-curated blocklists of domains known to serve advertisements, trackers, and malware.\<sup\>12\</sup\> When a device on your network requests a domain that is on one of these lists, Pi-hole intercepts the query. Instead of forwarding it to an upstream DNS provider (like Google or Cloudflare), Pi-hole responds with a false, non-routable IP address, such as `0.0.0.0`.\<sup\>14\</sup\> The client's browser or application receives this null address and is unable to establish a connection to the ad server. The ad is effectively blocked before it is ever downloaded.\<sup\>14\</sup\>

This network-level approach has several powerful advantages over traditional browser plugins:

* **Network-Wide Protection:** It protects all devices on the network, including those that can't run ad-blocking software, such as smart TVs, game consoles, and IoT devices.\<sup\>16\</sup\>
* **Performance and Efficiency:** By blocking ads at the DNS level, the data is never downloaded, which saves bandwidth and can make web pages load faster. Pi-hole also caches valid DNS queries, speeding up subsequent lookups for the same domains.
* **Insightful Dashboard:** A comprehensive web interface provides detailed statistics on all network activity, showing which devices are making which queries and what is being blocked.

#### Implementation & Troubleshooting Case Study \#1: The `network_mode: "host"` Trap

To function as a DNS server, Pi-hole must listen on the privileged port 53. A common shortcut to achieve this in Docker is to use `network_mode: "host"`. My initial `docker-compose.yml` for Pi-hole looked like this:

```yaml
# pihole/docker-compose.yml (Initial, Flawed Version)
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    network_mode: "host" # Shares the host's network stack directly
    #... other settings like volumes and environment variables
    restart: unless-stopped
```

This led to my first real troubleshooting challenge: **Asymmetrical Ad-Blocking**. Remote clients connected via Tailscale were getting ad-blocking, but the Ubuntu host machine itself was not. The investigation revealed that after disabling the host's default `systemd-resolved` service (a necessary step to free up port 53), the OS had reverted to using the `/etc/resolv.conf` file for its DNS lookups. This file was not configured to point to the local Pi-hole instance.

The resolution was to force the host OS to use its own local Pi-hole container for all DNS queries by editing `/etc/resolv.conf` to contain a single line:
`nameserver 127.0.0.1`

This directed all of the host's DNS traffic to the Pi-hole service listening on the local loopback address, and the issue was solved. However, this experience revealed the double-edged nature of `network_mode: "host"`. While it conveniently solves the immediate problem of port access, it does so by breaking a core tenet of containerization: **network isolation**.\<sup\>3\</sup\>

When a container uses host networking, it doesn't get its own isolated network stack; it shares the host's network directly.\<sup\>17\</sup\> This means if an application inside the container binds to a port, it is indistinguishable from a process on the host binding to that same port. In my case, Pi-hole bound not only to port 53 for DNS but also to port 80 for its web administration interface. This created a hidden port conflict that was a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode the moment I tried to deploy another service that needed the standard HTTP port 80. This experience teaches a fundamental lesson: **always prefer explicit port mapping and Docker's isolated bridge networks for long-term stability.** `network_mode: "host"` should be a rare exception, not the rule.

### Nginx Proxy Manager: The Front Door to Your Services

With multiple services planned for the server, accessing each one by its IP address and port number (e.g., `http://100.x.y.z:8080`, `http://100.x.y.z:8096`) is cumbersome and insecure. A reverse proxy solves this by acting as a single, unified gateway for all web-based applications.

#### Core Concept: What is a Reverse Proxy?

A reverse proxy is a server that sits in front of one or more backend web servers, intercepting all incoming client requests.\<sup\>18\</sup\> Think of it as an office building's receptionist: visitors don't go directly to individual offices; they check in at the front desk, and the receptionist directs them to the correct location. This is distinct from a forward proxy, which sits in front of client devices to filter their outbound traffic.

A reverse proxy provides several key benefits for a home lab \<sup\>19\</sup\>:

* **Security:** The internal IP addresses and ports of the application containers are completely hidden. Attackers can only see the reverse proxy.
* **Centralized SSL Termination:** It provides a single entry point and can handle the complexity of SSL/TLS encryption in one place. The proxy manages the secure HTTPS connection with the client, while communication between the proxy and the backend container can be plain HTTP over our secure internal Docker network.
* **Simplified URLs:** It allows us to use clean, memorable domain names (e.g., `https://photos.home.local`) instead of IP addresses and port numbers.

For our setup, we'll use Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM), which provides a beautiful and simple web interface for managing Nginx as a reverse proxy.\<sup\>20\</sup\>

#### Implementation & Troubleshooting Case Study \#2: The Inevitable Port Conflict

To allow NPM to communicate with application containers that will be defined in separate `docker-compose.yml` files, we need a shared, user-defined network.

1. **Create a Shared Docker Network:**
    This command creates a new bridge network named `npm-net`. Containers connected to this network can discover and communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames, a feature of Docker's built-in DNS service.\<sup\>22\</sup\>

    ```bash
    docker network create npm-net
    ```

2. **Deploy Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM):**
    The `docker-compose.yml` for NPM specifies that it should connect to our new `npm-net` network, which we declare as `external` since it was created outside of this Compose file.\<sup\>24\</sup\>

    ```yaml
    # npm/docker-compose.yml
    services:
      app:
        image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'
        container_name: npm
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - '80:80'    # Standard HTTP Port
          - '443:443'  # Standard HTTPS Port
          - '81:81'    # Admin UI Port
        volumes:
          -./data:/data
          -./letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt
        networks:
          - npm-net

    networks:
      npm-net:
        external: true
    ```

When I first tried to start this container, it failed with an `address already in use` error for port 80. This was the direct consequence of my earlier decision to use `network_mode: "host"` for Pi-hole. The Pi-hole container's web server was occupying port 80 on the host, causing the conflict.

**Diagnosis:** The `lsof` (list open files) command is an invaluable tool for identifying which process is using a specific port.

```bash
sudo lsof -i :80
```

The output clearly identified the `pihole-FTL` process as the culprit.

**Resolution:** The only correct solution was to refactor the Pi-hole configuration to eliminate `network_mode: "host"` and use explicit port mapping instead. This is the architecturally sound approach that maintains container isolation.

```yaml
# pihole/docker-compose.yml (Corrected Version)
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "8080:80/tcp" # Map host port 8080 to container port 80
    #... other settings
    restart: unless-stopped
```

This change maps the host's port 8080 to the Pi-hole container's port 80, freeing up the standard port 80 on the host for NPM to use. The Pi-hole admin interface is now accessible at `http://<server-ip>:8080`, and the NPM container starts successfully.

### Final Architecture and Request Flow

The deployment of these backbone services establishes a robust and scalable request flow. A request for a self-hosted service now follows this path: `Client` -\> `Tailscale Network` -\> `Pi-hole (for DNS)` -\> `Nginx Proxy Manager (Reverse Proxy)` -\> `Application Container`.

The roles of these core services are distinct and complementary, forming a powerful foundation for our private cloud.

| Service | Role in the Stack | Key Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tailscale** | Secure Overlay Network | Zero-config, encrypted access to the lab from anywhere, obviating the need for public port forwarding.\<sup\>10\</sup\> |
| **Pi-hole** | DNS Server & Ad-Blocker | Blocks unwanted content network-wide and resolves custom local domain names to the server's private IP.\<sup\>12\</sup\> |
| **NPM** | Reverse Proxy | Provides a single, secure entry point for all web services, handling SSL and routing traffic to the correct backend container.\<sup\>19\</sup\> |

With this infrastructure in place, our system is now prepared for the deployment of its first user-facing application. The next article will demonstrate this by installing Immich, a self-hosted photo management platform, and integrating it seamlessly into this architecture.

## Article 4: Your First Application - Secure Photo Management with Immich & HTTPS

### Introduction: Putting the Infrastructure to Work

With our server's foundational backbone—secure networking, DNS, and a reverse proxy—firmly established, it is time to deploy our first major application. For this, I chose Immich, a powerful, open-source, self-hosted alternative to services like Google Photos or Apple Photos. It offers a rich feature set including automatic mobile backup, multi-user support, and AI-powered object and facial recognition.

Deploying Immich serves as a practical, real-world test of the architecture we've built. It involves integrating a complex, multi-container application into our existing infrastructure, configuring local DNS and reverse proxy rules, and tackling the nuanced challenges of securing access for both web browsers and native mobile applications.

### Deploying and Integrating Immich

Immich is distributed as a Docker Compose project with several interconnected services, including the main server, a machine learning container, a database, and a Redis cache. The key to integrating it into our setup lies in modifying its `docker-compose.yml` to leverage the `npm-net` network we created in the previous article.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Modify the Immich `docker-compose.yml`:** The primary change is to connect the `immich-server` service, which handles the web UI and API, to our external `npm-net` network. It is also critical to remove or comment out the default `ports` mapping for this service. This is a crucial security step that ensures the application is only accessible through our reverse proxy, preventing any direct access that would bypass our security policies.

    *Excerpt from `immich/docker-compose.yml`*:

    ```yaml
    services:
      immich-server:
        #... other settings like container_name, image, etc.
        # ports: # This section is commented out or removed
        #   - 2283:3001
        networks:
          - default
          - npm-net # Connect to the external proxy network
      #... other services (immich-microservices, immich-machine-learning, etc.)

    networks:
      default:
        driver: bridge
      npm-net:
        external: true
    ```

2. **Create a Local DNS Record:** In the Pi-hole admin interface (`http://<server-ip>:8080`), navigate to "Local DNS" -\> "DNS Records" and create a new entry. This will map a user-friendly domain name to our server's static Tailscale IP address.

      * **Domain:** `immich.home.local`
      * **IP Address:** `100.x.y.z` (the server's Tailscale IP)

3. **Create the Proxy Host in NPM:** Log in to the Nginx Proxy Manager web UI (`http://<server-ip>:81`). Navigate to "Hosts" -\> "Proxy Hosts" and click "Add Proxy Host". We'll configure it to route traffic for our new domain to the Immich container.\<sup\>20\</sup\>

      * **Domain Name:** `immich.home.local`
      * **Scheme:** `http`
      * **Forward Hostname / IP:** `immich-server` (Docker can resolve this name to the container's IP on our shared `npm-net` network \<sup\>22\</sup\>)
      * **Forward Port:** `3001` (This was my initial, and incorrect, assumption)

#### Troubleshooting Case Study \#3: The 502 Bad Gateway Mystery

After completing the configuration, attempting to access `http://immich.home.local` resulted in a **502 Bad Gateway** error from Nginx Proxy Manager. This error typically indicates that the proxy successfully received the request but was unable to get a valid response from the backend service it was trying to forward the traffic to.

My debugging process was systematic:

1. **Container Health:** A quick `docker ps` confirmed all the Immich containers were running and healthy.
2. **Network Attachment:** `docker network inspect npm-net` confirmed that both the `npm` and `immich-server` containers were correctly attached to the shared network.
3. **Port Inspection:** The critical clue was discovered by carefully re-examining the output of `docker ps`. While the default Immich documentation might suggest port 3001, the running `immich-server` container was actually listening internally on **port 2283**. NPM was attempting to forward traffic to the wrong port.

This serves as a crucial lesson: **always verify application ports from the running container itself** rather than relying solely on documentation, which can sometimes be out of date or have configuration-dependent variations. The single source of truth for a running container's configuration is the Docker daemon. The `docker ps` and `docker inspect` commands are your most reliable friends in these situations.

**Resolution:** The solution was simple once the root cause was identified. I edited the proxy host settings in NPM for `immich.home.local` and changed the **Forward Port** from `3001` to `2283`. This immediately resolved the 502 error, and the Immich web interface became accessible.

### The Green Lock: Trusted Local HTTPS with `mkcert`

While the service is now accessible, it's over plain HTTP, resulting in "Not Secure" warnings in web browsers. The next step is to enable trusted HTTPS for this local domain. Standard SSL certificates from public Certificate Authorities (CAs) like Let's Encrypt cannot be issued for non-public domains like `.home.local`. This requires us to create our own private, locally-trusted CA.

#### Core Concept: The Local Certificate Problem

A standard self-signed certificate would encrypt the connection, but browsers would still display prominent security warnings because the certificate is not signed by a CA that they trust. The tool `mkcert` elegantly solves this problem.\<sup\>26\</sup\> It automates the process of:

1. Creating a private Certificate Authority.
2. Installing its root certificate into your local system and browser trust stores.
3. Generating certificates for your local domains that are signed by this new local CA.

Because your browser is configured to trust your local CA, it will also trust any certificate that CA signs, resulting in a valid "green lock" for local development domains without any warnings.\<sup\>27\</sup\>

#### Implementation

1. **Install `mkcert`:** Follow the official instructions to install the `mkcert` utility on your server. On Linux, this may require installing `nss-tools` or `libnss3-tools` for Firefox support.\<sup\>27\</sup\>

    ```bash
    # Example for Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt install libnss3-tools
    # Then install mkcert (e.g., via Homebrew or pre-built binary)
    ```

2. **Create and Install the Local CA:** This command is run once to generate the private CA and automatically install its root certificate in the system's trust stores.

    ```bash
    mkcert -install
    ```

3. **Generate a Wildcard Certificate:** To avoid generating a new certificate for every new service, we'll create a wildcard certificate. This single certificate will be valid for `immich.home.local`, `jellyfin.home.local`, and any other subdomain of `.home.local`.

    ```bash
    mkcert "*.home.local"
    ```

    This command produces two files: `_wildcard.home.local.pem` (the public certificate) and `_wildcard.home.local-key.pem` (the private key).

4. **Configure NPM:** In the NPM UI, navigate to "SSL Certificates" -\> "Add SSL Certificate" -\> "Custom". Upload the contents of the two `.pem` files you just created. Then, edit your `immich.home.local` proxy host, go to the "SSL" tab, and select your new wildcard certificate from the dropdown.

5. **Distribute the CA to Clients:** For other devices on your network (laptops, phones) to also trust this certificate, the local CA's root certificate file (`rootCA.pem`) must be exported from the server and installed on each client device. You can find the location of this file by running `mkcert -CAROOT`. The installation process varies by operating system but is a crucial final step.

With these steps completed, accessing `https://immich.home.local` from a configured client device's browser now shows a fully secure and trusted HTTPS connection.

#### Troubleshooting Case Study \#4: The Hardened Mobile App Conundrum

The final and most complex challenge arose when trying to connect the native Immich mobile app. Despite installing the `mkcert` root CA on my Android device, the app persistently failed to connect, reporting that the server was unreachable.

Extensive research revealed that this is not a bug, but an intentional security feature of many modern mobile applications. To protect against sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks, an app's networking library can be configured to use a technique called **certificate pinning** or to be hardcoded to only trust the public CAs built into the operating system. It will explicitly ignore any user-added CAs, which is exactly what our `mkcert` root certificate is. From the app's perspective, our server's certificate is untrusted, and it rightly refuses to connect.

This situation presents a conflict between two valid security models: our "trusted local CA" model that works perfectly for browsers, and the stricter "public CAs only" model of the mobile app. To resolve this, it's necessary to re-evaluate the actual security requirements of the connection by looking at the whole system.

The entire connection from the mobile device to the server is already being transmitted through an end-to-end encrypted WireGuard tunnel provided by Tailscale.\<sup\>10\</sup\> This means the data in transit is already secure. The primary benefit of TLS that is failing here—authenticating the server with a certificate—is less critical when the entire network path is already authenticated and encrypted by another strong layer.

This understanding allows for a pragmatic architectural decision. Instead of trying to force the app to accept a certificate it is designed to reject, we can create a separate, unencrypted endpoint exclusively for the mobile app, while relying on the robust security of the Tailscale layer. This is not a "less secure" solution; it is a pragmatic one that leverages the security of the whole system to work around a limitation in a single component, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of layered security.

**Resolution:**

1. **New DNS Record:** In Pi-hole, create a new local DNS record: `immich-app.home.local`, pointing to the same server Tailscale IP.
2. **New Proxy Host:** In NPM, create a corresponding new proxy host for `immich-app.home.local`, forwarding to `immich-server` on port `2283`.
3. **Disable SSL:** Critically, in the SSL tab for this new proxy host, set the SSL option to `None`.
4. **Configure Mobile App:** In the Immich mobile app, set the server endpoint URL to `http://immich-app.home.local`.

This solution works perfectly. The mobile app connects over plain HTTP to the reverse proxy, which then forwards the request to the Immich container. The entire transaction, from phone to server, remains fully encrypted by Tailscale.

## Article 5: The Automated Media Empire

### Introduction: Architecting the Ultimate Media Stack

Having successfully deployed and secured a personal photo management service, the next logical expansion of our private cloud is a comprehensive, automated media system. The goal is to create a "set it and forget it" pipeline for acquiring, organizing, and serving movies and TV shows to any device, both inside and outside the home.

This requires a suite of specialized, interconnected applications, often referred to as the "Arr stack." Each component has a specific job, and when combined, they form a powerful and seamless media automation engine. This article details the architecture and deployment of this entire stack, including routing specific traffic through a VPN for privacy and leveraging our server's GPU for high-performance video transcoding.

To navigate this new fleet of services, here is a quick guide to the cast of characters and their roles in our media empire.

| Service | Role in the Stack | Key Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gluetun** | VPN Client / Network Gateway | Routes specific container traffic through a commercial VPN with a built-in kill switch for privacy.\<sup\>29\</sup\> |
| **qBittorrent** | Download Client | Handles the acquisition of files (e.g., torrents). |
| **Prowlarr** | Indexer Manager | Manages and syncs indexer configurations across the other \*Arr apps, acting as a single source of truth. |
| **Sonarr** | TV Show Automation | Monitors for, searches, and grabs new episodes of TV shows, handling renaming and organization. |
| **Radarr** | Movie Automation | Monitors for, searches, and grabs movies based on quality profiles, handling renaming and organization. |
| **Jellyseerr**| Media Request System | Provides a user-friendly, Netflix-like portal for users (or you) to discover and request new media. |
| **Jellyfin** | Media Server / Player | Organizes, serves, and transcodes the entire media library for beautiful playback on any client device.\<sup\>30\</sup\> |

### Gluetun: The Privacy Kill Switch

A core requirement for the download client in our stack is privacy. It is standard practice to route traffic from torrent clients through a commercial VPN service. However, routing all server traffic through the VPN is undesirable, as it would slow down direct access to other services like Immich or Jellyfin and complicate local network communication. The solution is selective routing.

#### Core Concept: Selective VPN Routing and the Kill Switch

Gluetun is a lightweight, containerized VPN client designed specifically for this purpose. It establishes a connection to a chosen commercial VPN provider (supporting dozens out of the box with either OpenVPN or WireGuard protocols) and acts as a network gateway for other Docker containers.\<sup\>29\</sup\>

Its most critical feature is its **integrated kill switch**. If the connection to the VPN provider ever drops, Gluetun immediately cuts off all network connectivity for any containers routed through it. This prevents the download client from accidentally reverting to the server's main internet connection and leaking its public IP address, ensuring privacy is maintained even in the event of a VPN failure.\<sup\>29\</sup\>

#### Implementation

The `gluetun` service is the foundational networking component in our `media-stack/docker-compose.yml`. It requires special privileges and specific environment variables to function.

*`gluetun` service block from `media-stack/docker-compose.yml`*:

```yaml
services:
  gluetun:
    image: qmcgaw/gluetun
    container_name: gluetun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN # Required to create and manage network interfaces
    environment:
      - VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER=${VPN_SERVICE_PROVIDER}
      - VPN_TYPE=${VPN_TYPE}
      - WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY=${WIREGUARD_PRIVATE_KEY}
      - WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES=${WIREGUARD_ADDRESSES}
      - SERVER_CITIES=${SERVER_CITIES}
    ports:
      - "8118:8080" # Port for qBittorrent WebUI
      - "6881:6881" # Ports for torrent traffic
      - "6881:6881/udp"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The `cap_add: - NET_ADMIN` directive is essential, as it grants the container the Linux capabilities required to modify network routing tables and create the VPN tunnel interface.\<sup\>29\</sup\> The environment variables, which contain sensitive credentials, are populated from a `.env` file that is excluded from our Git repository.\<sup\>32\</sup\>

### Deploying the Full Stack: A Deep Dive into Docker Compose

The entire media stack is defined within a single `docker-compose.yml` file, ensuring all components are managed as a cohesive unit.

#### qBittorrent and `network_mode`

The `qbittorrent` service configuration is where we implement the selective VPN routing.

*`qbittorrent` service block*:

```yaml
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    container_name: qbittorrent
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID}
      - PGID=${PGID}
      - TZ=${TZ}
      - WEBUI_PORT=8080
    volumes:
      - ${DATA_PATH}/appdata/qbittorrent:/config
      - ${DATA_PATH}/media:/data
    network_mode: "service:gluetun" # Critical line
    depends_on:
      - gluetun
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The directive `network_mode: "service:gluetun"` is the key to this entire setup.\<sup\>33\</sup\> It instructs Docker to not give the `qbittorrent` container its own network stack. Instead, it is attached directly to the network namespace of the `gluetun` container.\<sup\>34\</sup\> This means `qbittorrent` shares the same IP address and network interfaces as `gluetun`, forcing all of its outbound traffic through the VPN tunnel. A direct consequence is that any ports that need to be exposed for qBittorrent (like its web UI) must be published on the `gluetun` service definition, as seen in the previous section.

#### \*Arr Stack and Jellyfin

The remaining services (\*Arr applications and Jellyfin) are configured more conventionally, as they do not need to be routed through the VPN.

* **Standard Configuration:** For Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, and Jellyseerr, the configuration involves standard port mappings for their web interfaces and volume mounts for their configuration data.
* **Permissions (PUID/PGID):** The `PUID` (User ID) and `PGID` (Group ID) environment variables are crucial for managing file permissions. They ensure that any files created by the applications inside the containers (such as organized media files) are owned by the correct user on the host machine, preventing common and frustrating permissions errors when Jellyfin tries to access the media library.
* **Jellyfin and GPU Transcoding:** The `jellyfin` service includes a special `deploy` section to enable hardware-accelerated transcoding using our server's NVIDIA GPU.

    ```yaml
    # In the jellyfin service definition
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: all
              capabilities: [gpu]
    ```

    This configuration, which requires the NVIDIA Container Toolkit to be installed on the host, passes the host's GPU into the container.\<sup\>35\</sup\> This allows Jellyfin to use NVIDIA's dedicated NVENC/NVDEC engines to encode and decode video streams. This is vastly more efficient than CPU-based (software) transcoding, enabling smooth playback of high-bitrate 4K content to multiple clients simultaneously without overwhelming the server's CPU.\<sup\>37\</sup\>

### The Hidden Challenge of Inter-Container Communication with a VPN

This architecture introduces a non-obvious networking challenge that can stump even experienced users. In a standard Docker Compose setup, all services are placed on a default bridge network and can communicate with each other using their service names (e.g., Sonarr could reach qBittorrent at `http://qbittorrent:8080`).\<sup\>24\</sup\>

However, the use of `network_mode: "service:gluetun"` removes the `qbittorrent` container from this default network.\<sup\>40\</sup\> It now exists solely within the isolated network namespace of the `gluetun` container. As a result, if Sonarr attempts to connect to the hostname `qbittorrent`, the request will fail because Docker's DNS service on the default network no longer has a record for it.

The solution lies in understanding how the services are exposed. Sonarr and Radarr, which are outside the VPN "bubble," cannot talk to `qbittorrent` directly via Docker's internal DNS. They must communicate with it via the port that was published on the `gluetun` container. Therefore, when configuring the download client within Sonarr or Radarr, the hostname to use is not `qbittorrent`, but rather the IP address of the server itself (our static Tailscale IP is perfect for this) and the port mapped on the `gluetun` service.

**Correct Download Client Host in Sonarr/Radarr:** `http://100.x.y.z:8118`

This configuration directs the request from Sonarr to the host server on port 8118. Docker then forwards this to the `gluetun` container, which in turn passes it to the `qbittorrent` web UI listening on its internal port 8080. This reveals a critical architectural pattern: services inside the VPN are accessed by services outside the VPN through the VPN container's published ports, using the host's IP address.

### Proxying and Finalizing the Media Empire

The final step is to integrate these new services into our reverse proxy for easy and secure access. For each service with a web interface (Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Jellyseerr, and the qBittorrent UI via Gluetun), the process is the same as it was for Immich:

1. Create a local DNS record in Pi-hole (e.g., `jellyfin.home.local` -\> `100.x.y.z`).
2. Create a proxy host in Nginx Proxy Manager, pointing to the correct container name and internal port (e.g., `jellyfin` on port `8096`).
3. Assign the `*.home.local` wildcard SSL certificate we created with `mkcert`.

With all services deployed and proxied, the automated media empire is complete. A user can request a movie through the Jellyseerr interface, Radarr will automatically find it, send it to qBittorrent to download (privately through the VPN), and minutes later it will appear, fully organized with artwork and metadata, in the Jellyfin library, ready to be streamed securely to any device.

## Article 6: Management, Monitoring, and Final Touches

### Introduction: Polishing Your Private Cloud

A collection of running services forms a functional server, but a truly robust and user-friendly private cloud requires a layer of management and observability. The final stage of this project moves beyond deploying applications to adding tools that provide a centralized view of the entire system, simplify common administrative tasks, and formalize the "Infrastructure as Code" principle we set out to follow.

This article details the deployment of a dashboard with Homepage, a simple command runner with Olivetin, and the best practices for maintaining the project in a version-controlled repository. These final touches will transform our setup from a functional hobby project into a polished, manageable platform.

### A Pane of Glass with Homepage

As the number of self-hosted services grows, keeping track of them all—their URLs, their status, their API keys—becomes a challenge. A dashboard provides a "single pane of glass" to view and access the entire ecosystem. Homepage is a modern, highly customizable, and lightweight dashboard that is perfect for this role. It is served as a static web page, but it dynamically populates itself with live data by connecting to the APIs of your various services.\<sup\>41\</sup\>

#### Concept

Homepage provides widgets that can display real-time information, such as \<sup\>41\</sup\>:

* The number of active torrents and current download/upload speeds from qBittorrent.
* Recently added movies and TV shows from Jellyfin.
* The percentage of DNS queries blocked by Pi-hole.
* The status and health of all running Docker containers.

This turns the dashboard from a simple list of links into a dynamic and informative system overview.

#### Implementation

Homepage is deployed as another Docker container. Its configuration is managed through a set of YAML files mounted as a volume.

*`homepage/docker-compose.yml`*:

```yaml
services:
  homepage:
    image: ghcr.io/gethomepage/homepage:latest
    container_name: homepage
    environment:
      - PUID=${PUID}
      - PGID=${PGID}
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      -./config:/app/config
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # For Docker widget
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Mounting the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into the container is what allows the Docker widget to function. It gives Homepage read-only (`:ro`) access to the Docker daemon's API, allowing it to query container status without being able to modify them.\<sup\>42\</sup\>

The dashboard's layout, services, and widgets are defined in YAML files within the `config` directory.

* `services.yaml`: Defines groups of services (e.g., "Media," "Infrastructure") and the links for each service.
* `widgets.yaml`: Configures the dynamic widgets. Each widget requires credentials, typically an API key, to communicate with its target service.

To avoid hardcoding secrets like API keys in our configuration files (which will be committed to Git), Homepage can read them from environment variables. My repository includes a `homepage/.env.template` file that provides a template for all the necessary keys for the services we've deployed. You simply copy this to `.env` and fill in your secrets. As with all our other services, we create a local DNS record (`homepage.home.local`) and a reverse proxy entry in NPM to provide easy and secure access to the dashboard via `https://homepage.home.local`.

### Simple Scripting with Olivetin

While SSH provides full control over the server, sometimes a simpler, web-based method for executing common, predefined commands is useful. Olivetin is a minimalist web UI designed for exactly this purpose. It reads a configuration file and presents a simple webpage with buttons that trigger specific shell scripts.\<sup\>43\</sup\>

#### Concept

For this project, Olivetin provides a straightforward way to start and stop the entire application stack without needing to SSH into the server and navigate to the correct directories. It's a lightweight and secure alternative to exposing more complex management tools. Its security comes from its explicit, allow-list nature: it can only execute the exact commands that have been predefined in its configuration file, nothing more.\<sup\>43\</sup\> This makes it safe to expose on the local network, even for less technical users.

#### Implementation

Olivetin is deployed as a simple Docker container.

*`olivetin/docker-compose.yml`*:

```yaml
services:
  olivetin:
    container_name: olivetin
    image: jamesread/olivetin:latest
    privileged: true # Often needed to interact with Docker
    volumes:
      -../media-stack:/media-stack # Mount directories containing scripts
      -./config:/config
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - "1337:1337"
```

The available actions are defined in `config/config.yaml`. This file is configured to present buttons that execute `start-all.sh` and `stop-all.sh` scripts located in the project's root directory. These scripts, in turn, simply iterate through the subdirectories (`pihole`, `npm`, `media-stack`, etc.) and run the appropriate `docker compose up -d` or `docker compose down` commands.

### Infrastructure as Code: The GitHub Repository

The principle of "Reproducibility" is best realized by maintaining the entire project configuration in a Git repository. This approach, known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), treats the server's configuration as source code, providing version control, history, and a single source of truth for the entire setup.\<sup\>1\</sup\>

A clean repository structure is not just about tidiness; it's about clarity and maintainability. My final project structure is clean and logical:

```plaintext
.
├── homepage/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── config/
│   └── .env.template
├── immich/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── .env.template
├── media-stack/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── .env.template
├── npm/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── .env.template
├── olivetin/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── config/
├── pihole/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   └── .env.template
├── start-all.sh
└──
```

Each directory contains the `docker-compose.yml` for that service or stack, along with any necessary configuration files.

A critical component of this strategy is the management of secrets. Committing API keys, passwords, and other credentials to a public Git repository is a catastrophic security failure. The `.env` and `.env.template` pattern is the industry-standard solution.

* **.env.template:** A template file is created in each service directory. It defines all the required environment variables (passwords, API keys, user IDs) with placeholder values. This file is committed to Git.
* **.env:** The user copies the template to a new file named `.env` and fills in the actual secret values.
* **.gitignore:** A `.gitignore` file at the root of the repository explicitly tells Git to ignore all files named `.env`.

This practice ensures that sensitive credentials are never committed to version control, while still providing a clear template for anyone (including your future self) looking to replicate the setup. Sharing this repository on a platform like GitHub not only provides a personal backup but also contributes to the open-source community, allowing others to learn from, adapt, and improve upon the architecture.

### Conclusion and The Path Forward

This series has chronicled the journey from a bare Ubuntu server to a fully-featured, secure, and manageable private cloud. Along the way, we have covered essential skills and concepts that are fundamental to modern self-hosting:

* **Security:** Hardening the host OS and implementing a zero-trust network with Tailscale.
* **Networking:** Mastering DNS with Pi-hole, reverse proxying with NPM, and advanced Docker networking for selective VPN routing.
* **Application Deployment:** Deploying both single and complex multi-container applications with Docker Compose.
* **Local HTTPS:** Generating and managing locally trusted SSL certificates with `mkcert`.
* **Management:** Creating a centralized dashboard and simple management tools.

The resulting platform is not just a collection of services; it is a robust and extensible foundation. The path forward is open to countless possibilities, building upon the skills and infrastructure we've established here. Future projects could include:

* **Automated Backups:** Implementing a tool like `restic` or `borg` to create encrypted, off-site backups of container volumes and critical configuration data.
* **Advanced Monitoring:** Deploying a Prometheus and Grafana stack to collect and visualize detailed performance metrics from the server and its containers.
* **Centralized Logging:** Using a stack like Loki and Promtail to aggregate logs from all containers into a single, searchable interface.
* **Expanding Services:** Adding other popular self-hosted applications, such as Nextcloud for file synchronization, Vaultwarden for password management, or Home Assistant for smart home automation.\<sup\>44\</sup\>

The journey of self-hosting is one of continuous learning and building. I hope this guide has provided a comprehensive and battle-tested starting point, empowering you to take control of your data and build your own private cloud. Happy hosting\!
