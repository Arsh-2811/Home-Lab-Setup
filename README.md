# My Home Lab Setup

This repository contains the configuration for my personal home lab, which is managed primarily with Docker and Docker Compose.

The goal of this setup is to be easy to manage, scalable, and well-documented.

  * **Media Streaming**: Jellyfin for streaming media to various devices on the local network.
  * **Centralized Dashboard**: A beautiful and functional dashboard using [Homepage](https://gethomepage.dev/) to access all services from one place.
  * **Network-wide Ad Blocking**: Pi-hole for blocking ads and trackers on all devices on the network.
  * **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx Proxy Manager for easy and secure access to services with SSL certificates.
  * **Photo Management**: Immich for self-hosting and managing a personal photo library.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

  * Docker and Docker Compose installed on your server.
  * A user with `sudo` privileges to run Docker commands.
  * Git for cloning the repository.
  * A VPN subscription (this setup is configured for Mullvad with WireGuard, but can be adapted).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-lab-setup.git
    cd home-lab-setup
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Each service stack that requires environment variables has a `.env.template` file. You need to copy these templates to `.env` and fill in the values.

      * **Media Stack:**

        ```bash
        cp media-stack/.env.template media-stack/.env
        nano media-stack/.env
        ```

        You will need to set your `TZ`, `PUID`, `PGID`, `DATA_PATH`, and VPN credentials.

      * **Homepage:**

        ```bash
        cp homepage/.env.template homepage/.env
        nano homepage/.env
        ```

        Fill in the API keys and credentials for the services you want to integrate with the dashboard widgets.

      * **Immich:**

        ```bash
        cp immich/.env.template immich/.env
        nano immich/.env
        ```

        Set the `UPLOAD_LOCATION`, `DB_DATA_LOCATION`, and database credentials.

      * **Pi-hole:**

        ```bash
        cp pihole/.env.template pihole/.env
        nano pihole/.env
        ```

        Set a `WEBPASSWORD` for the Pi-hole web interface.

3.  **Create External Docker Network:**
    This setup uses an external network `npm-net` for the reverse proxy to communicate with other services. Create it with the following command:

    ```bash
    docker network create npm-net
    ```

### Usage

This repository includes scripts to easily manage all the services.

  * **Start all services:**
    ```bash
    ./start-all.sh
    ```
  * **Stop all services:**
    ```bash
    ./stop-all.sh
    ```

You can also manage individual stacks by navigating to their directories and using `docker compose up -d` or `docker compose down`. The `media-stack` and `olivetin` directories also contain more granular scripts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Pi-hole

The Pi-hole configuration is managed in `pihole/etc-pihole/pihole.toml`. This setup includes several customizations:

  * **Custom DNS Records**: Local DNS records are defined in the `hosts` array to provide easy-to-remember domain names for services (e.g., `jellyfin.home.local`).
  * **Adlist**: A default adlist is included in `pihole/etc-pihole/adlists.list`.
  * **Listening Behavior**: The `listeningMode` is set to `ALL` to accept DNS queries from all interfaces. Ensure your firewall is configured correctly.

### Homepage

The Homepage dashboard is configured via YAML files in the `homepage/config/` directory:

  * **`services.yaml`**: Defines the service groups and the services within them, along with their icons, URLs, and widget configurations.
  * **`settings.yaml`**: Sets the title, theme, and layout of the dashboard.
  * **`widgets.yaml`**: Configures global widgets like resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk), a search bar, and a datetime display.
  * **`bookmarks.yaml`**: Can be used to add bookmarks to the dashboard.

### Olivetin

The scripts available in Olivetin are defined in `olivetin/config/config.yaml`. This is a convenient way to start and stop parts of the media stack from a web UI.
